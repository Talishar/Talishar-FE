        <h1>Authorization Key Cookie</h1>
        <p>
          When you play a game on Talishar, an "authorization key" is generated
          for you to use to authentication your actions on that game. This is
          what prevents others on the internet from executing game actions on
          your behalf. This authentication key is stored as a cookie in your
          browser. It is necessary for the operation of the game. In order to
          not receive this cookie, you must not play the game.
